*Machine Learning Project :*

**MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION :**                                 
Mchine Learning | SVM | Logistic Regression | Naive Bayes | Random Forest
● In this project, we implemented and evaluated various machine
learning models to classify movie genres based on plot
summaries. The Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel
achieved the highest accuracy (0.541), outperforming other
models.The Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel
showcasing their effectiveness in multi-class classification
tasks,Logistic Regression and SVM with a sigmoid kernel also
performed relatively well.

**CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION :**                                 
Machine Learning | Gradient Boosting | Random Forest | Logistic Regression 
●In this project we have developed and evaluated models for
predicting customer churn, with Gradient Boosting emerging as
the most accurate model, offering valuable insights for customer
retention strategies. Gradient Boosting achieved the highest
accuracy of 87.12%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting
customer churn. It showed high precision (0.88) and recall (0.97)
for non-churners and improved performance for churners
(precision of 0.77 and recall of 0.47), demonstrating a balanced
prediction for both classes. Random Forest also performed well
with an accuracy of 86.44%, achieving a good balance between
precision and recall for both classes and improving the detection
of churners (recall of 0.44). Logistic Regression provided baseline
performance with an accuracy of 81.24%, showing high precision
(0.83) and recall (0.96) for predicting non-churners but
struggling with predicting churners, leading to more false
negatives due to a low recall of 0.18.
